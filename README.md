Additionally, I implemented the following extra credit features:

1. Prohibit username change if edit text field is empty
2. Long pressing img cover changes text color
3. Utilizes a barrier and a guideline in ConstraintLayout
4. All hardcoded strings, dimensions and colors are extracted to xml
5. Album cover image is 1:1 with width matches the screen width
6. Implements the app using another type of layout (Linear Layout)
